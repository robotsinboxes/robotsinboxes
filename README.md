# Hi! My name is Lisa Goodell...

## I recently graduated from UT's full stack web development course and am working hard to build up my portfolio.

Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects: completing my portfolio website as well as seeing four other fun projects to completion.
Always open to any suggestions or tips from other developers as I continue learning best practices, how to write code that is super clean and efficient.

My skills include working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React, and I have some experience with databases and APIs as well. That said I am also learning about D3.js and excited to learn Three.js and eventually Python.

I am looking forward to this journey and ready to take on my first tech job!
