## Hi! My name is Lisa...

While I graduated from UT as a full stack engineer, I truly enjoy working front end in React and learning UI/UX design. Driven by curiosity and resolve, I am always eager to expand my knowledge and build upon the skills I have through mentorship and hard work.

I am an empathy focused, passionate person, and believe in putting my whole self into everything that I do. This is what motivates me each day to grow as a UX / UI designer!

I'm always open to any suggestions or tips from other developers as I continue learning best practices and how to write code that is super clean and responsive. Thanks for taking a look!
