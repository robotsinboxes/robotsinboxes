## Hi! My name is Lisa Goodell...

### A recent graduate from UT's full stack web development course and am currently working hard to build up my portfolio.

My skills include working with **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js** and **React**, and I have experience with databases and APIs as well. 

I am also learning **D3.js** and excited to learn **Three.js** and eventually **Python**. While I am a full stack developer, I really love front-end development. As an artist, I find that UI/UX satifies both my love for science and math as well as my need to be creative.

I'm always open to any suggestions or tips from other developers as I continue learning best practices and how to write code that is super clean and responsive. I am looking forward to this journey and ready to take on my first tech job!
