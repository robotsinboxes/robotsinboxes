# Hi! My name is Lisa Goodell...

## I recently graduated from UT's full stack web development course and am working hard to build up my portfolio.

Iâ€™m currently completing my portfolio website as well as seeing four other fun projects to completion. My skills include working with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and React, and I have some experience with databases and APIs as well. 

That said I am also learning about D3.js and excited to learn Three.js and eventually Python. While I am a full stack developer, I really love working with UI/UX. As an artist, I find that it satifies both my love for science and math as well as my need to be creative.

I'm always open to any suggestions or tips from other developers as I continue learning best practices and how to write code that is super clean and efficient. I am looking forward to this journey and ready to take on my first tech job!
