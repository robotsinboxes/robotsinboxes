# Hi! My name is Lisa Goodell...

## I recently graduated from UT's full stack web development course and am working hard to build up my portfolio.

Iâ€™m currently working on a few projects: completing my portfolio website as well as seeing four other fun projects to completion.
Open to any suggestions or tips from other developers; I expect to continue learning best practices, how to write code that is super clean and efficient.

I am looking forward to this journey and ready to take on my first tech job!
